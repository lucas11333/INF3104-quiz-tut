## - Simulation Test

## 1. Variable Amount Test

```{r}
unique(friends_df$People_who_measure)

```

## 2. Null Value test

```{r}
any(is.na(friends_df))

```

## 3. The Count Variables Test

```{r}
ncol(friends_df)
```

## 4. Check if Contain the Duplicate Variables

```{r}
if (!any(duplicated(friends_df))) {
  print("No duplicate rows found.")
} else {
  print("Contain the duplicate rows.")
}
```

## 5. The Normal Test

```{r}
for (i in 2:ncol(friends_df)) {
  if (shapiro.test(friends_df[,i])$p.value >= 0.05) {
    print(paste("The Column", colnames(friends_df)[i], "is normal."))
  } else {
    print(paste("oops ! Failed for column", colnames(friends_df)[i], "."))
  }
}

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
